class Singleton:
	"""
	A non-thread-safe helper class to ease implementing singletons.
	This should be used as a decorator -- not a metaclass -- to the
	class that should be a singleton.

	The decorated class can define one `__init__` function that
	takes only the `self` argument. Also, the decorated class cannot be
	inherited from. Other than that, there are no restrictions that apply
	to the decorated class.

	To get the singleton instance, use the `Instance` method. Trying
	to use `__call__` will result in a `TypeError` being raised.

		Returns the singleton instance. Upon its first call, it creates a
		new instance of the decorated class and calls its `__init__` method.
		On all subsequent calls, the already created instance is returned.
